After making changes go through these steps:

1 - bash check.sh
  - get all files that are greater than 50Mb
2 - .check
  - check this file to make sure all files are less than 50Mb
3 - bash push.sh
  - push changes to GitHub

In .gitignore leave a blank line at the end. This is necessary for check.sh
